Write a C program that will execute repetitively using a simple menu as following:
1-Fibonacci sequence
2-Check a date
3- Sum of even integers from 0 to n (except n)
4-Quit
Choose an operation:
1- When the option 1 is selected, the program will accept a positive integral number,
called as n, then the first n Fibonacci numbers will be printed out
2- When the option 2 is selected, the program will accept a date then the program will
tell that whether this data is valid or not.
3- When the option 3 is selected, the program will accept a positive integral number,
called as n, so that print out the sum of even integers from 0 to n (except n).
4- If the option 4 is selected, the program quits
